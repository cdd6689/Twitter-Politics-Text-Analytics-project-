Democratic Candidates Text Analysis Group Project

• Used lift and sentiment scoring to understand 2020 presidential democratic candidate’s public and media perceptions

• Scraped over 17,000 tweets and 12,000 new articles and used nltk preprocessing steps such as tokenization, lamentation, and removing stop words before scoring

• Learned that Joe Biden was the most talked about but least popular candidate and recommended that he use social media more to connect with voters while backing away from his criminal justice policies.
